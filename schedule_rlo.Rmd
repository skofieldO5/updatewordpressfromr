<!-- This scirpt gets the schedule from the baseball league, transforms it how

library(httr) # is used to get the HTML document
library(xml2) # read out the HTML document
library(rvest) # get individual nodes from the HTML document

#this looks more complicated than it is. mgsub() enables us to replace more than one character string
#at once. so we feed it two vectors. the first one contains what we want to replace and the second one
#with what we want to replace it. It goes in order so for example "Rohrbach Crazy Geese" gets 
#replaced with "Crazy Geese". Finally we use lapply() to perform this on the whole data.table

#in the "Ergebnis_zeit" column there is either the result of the game or, if the games wasn't
#played yet, the time of the game. I don't want this. I want one column for the date, one for
#the time of the game and one with the result. This is why here I store the line numbers of
#where there is a result in a vector
ergebnisse <- grepl(" - ", schedule$`Time/Results`)
#now I use this vector to fill in the result in the new column "Ergebnis". All the others
#get a " - " because there is no result for future games of course

#even though class() still gives me data.table back, just to be sure I wrap the whole comannd into 
#an as.data.table())

#in the final table I want every game which is played at our home field to be in blue
#therefore I save the lines where this is the case in a variable
blue_rows <- which(schedule$Spielort %in% "Rohrbach")

#we produce our final nicely formatted (HTML) table. I want all the columns to be centered.

#that the table is responsive and with the row_spec function I color in all games that are
#played on our home field

<!-- Now to the part that where we actually show the HTML output. I just want a simple line
that says Regular Season and show the table after it. -->
