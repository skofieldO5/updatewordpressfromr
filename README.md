I wrote this couple of scripts to automatically update my baeball clubs homepage www.crazy-geese.at

It basically gets the standings and schedules from baseballaustria.com and from abbqs.at, it processes
this data and automatically uploads it to my clubs homepage. 

Here the files in detail:

next_events.
