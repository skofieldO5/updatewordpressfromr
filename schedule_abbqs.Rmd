#an as.data.table())

#in the "Ergebnis_zeit" column there is either the result of the game or, if the games wasn't
#played yet, the time of the game. I don't want this. I want one column for the date, one for
#the time of the game and one with the result. This is why here I store the line numbers of
#where there is a result in a vector

#this looks more complicated than it is. mgsub() enables us to replace more than one character string
